# Test task for a frontend developer

There is a service where a table view is a typical and useful component. One of the examples is a User "list".
One of the important features of such a view is an ability to filter users. Each user in our system is assigned to a user plan
There is a common task to show all users that have selected plans. 

So we need a table view with a filter in one column (the user plans column).

## Implementation details

- We use react
- We use material-ui components
- For certain reasons we want to use material-table, see the filtering [example|https://material-table.com/#/docs/features/filtering] straight away.
- We'd like to see customized selects in our app, not defualt material-ui selects. See an [example here|https://material-table.com/#/docs/features/filtering]

## Acceptance criteria
